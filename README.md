###  Analysis of Classification Algorithms for Liver Disease Diagnosis

To find an effective algorithm to predict and analyse liver
disease based on their accuracy, precision and recall. The performance metrics of
the three algorithms Random forest, Naïve Bayes and Adaptive boosting algorithm
are found and compared. To improve the accuracy of the model feature selection is
implemented using the data mining tool, RapidMiner. The Indian Liver Patient
Dataset is used for testing the algorithms in order to classify the people having liver
disorder.
